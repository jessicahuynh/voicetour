		"description":"The Carl J. Shapiro Science Center is home to many of our undergraduate science programs. The center is comprised of three main centers, the Gerstenzang Science Library (commonly referred to as G-Zang by students), and other research facilities. The first center is the Brandeis University National Center for Behavioral Genomics which focuses on brain function and behavior in addition to finding therapeutic strategies for brain disease and dysfunction. The second is The Volen Center, or National Center for Complex Systems, in which faculty and students study the brain and intelligence. This center’s staff specialize in artificial intelligence, cognitive science, and various neuroscience topics (examples include experimental psychology, computational neuroscience, and cellular and molecular neurobiology). The final center is The Brandeis Materials Research Science and Engineering Center which focuses on developing the relationship between biology and materials science via a top-down and bottom-up method. Each center was founded with interdisciplinary study in mind. In fact, a few classes are taught by faculty of varying disciplines – one class is even taught by three professors – a biologist, a chemist, and a physicist. This interdisciplinary approach is different from the instruction methods at most universities. Beyond the centers, faculty and students from many departments collaborate in research, in the classrooms and in the labs. The Leo Gerstenzang Complex has traditional lab areas as well as special classrooms for teaching math and science. Brandeis Students have many opportunities to engage in research during their undergraduate years. In fact, since 2003, undergraduate students have co-authored over one hundred and thirty published articles. ",

In the very center of the monument is a beautiful mosaic of a dove — the international symbol of peace. Encircling the mosaic are tiles engraved with the word 'peace' in the languages spoken at Brandeis. There are approximately 40 different language bricks. Building for Peace set out to further the beauty and breadth of the Peace Monument by adding bricks and improving the garden. There are hopes to add approximately 20 more language bricks (including American Sign Language and Braile), various cultural symbols of peace, a dedication plaque and a 'peace tree.' Part of the financing for what we now call the Mandel Peace Garden, came from generous benefactor Jay A. Mandel '80 and his life partner, Jeffrey M. Scheckner, in memory of Jay's grandparents, Harry and Violet Mandel.",
