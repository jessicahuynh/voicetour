# Brandeis Voice Tour

This is going to be a web and mobile app with multi-modal navigation that tours around [Brandeis University](http://www.brandeis.edu)'s campus.

## Planned features
* Find your current location on campus
* Search through locations
* Navigate between locations, inside and out
* Self-guided tour
* Follow fixed tours
* Create own tour
* Display information about locations (description, open hours, etc.)

All of these features are planned to be used with voice commands as well. We will also have the ability to have information read to you.
